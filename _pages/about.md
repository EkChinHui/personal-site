I am a Computer Science Student currently enrolled in National University of Singapore. I am an explorer at heart and venture into a wide range of topics, fields and technologies, meaning there is little that doesn't pique my interest. In my curiosity, I have dabbled in web development, machine learning, hardware projects, pixel art, game development and much more to come (find them [here](/portfolio)).

> A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one

With tech trends fluctuating ever so often, it seems futile to stick to one in the long run. I find it much more fulfilling to cast my net wide and learn just enough about each technology to be effective. Gaps in knowledge are then easily solved with my good friend [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) but more importantly spotting recurring patterns from other technologies that I've tried.

Do approach me if you would like to collaborate... or make a friend ;)
