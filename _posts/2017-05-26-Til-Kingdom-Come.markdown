**Til Kingdom Come is a free-to-play, 2D medieval fighting game that puts a spin on the timeless street fighter genre.**

This project was developed for Orbital 2020, a module in NUS where we are free to develop any project that we can conceive of. I chose to develop a game with my partner as we have both enjoyed many online games and wanted to give game development a shot.

It was tough working with a completely new language (C#) and even a new domain. Besides learning how to learn, it was interesting to see the different considerations in game design that has to be made while developing a game. Many features that I often take for granted while playing games such as music, artwork and animations were brought to my attention and has really made me appreciate games more.
