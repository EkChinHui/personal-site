**This project uses pose detection to detect falls in real-time in hopes of being applied to sectors such as healthcare.**

Observing the stress put on the healthcare sector due to the pandemic, we embarked on this project targeting it towards detecting falls for elderly lightening the load for healthcare workers. Working in a team of 6, we aggregated existing approaches to fall detection and tweaked the approach to achieve an accuracy of 99.92% with our test set. 

Through this Introduction to Machine Learning (ML) module, I learnt both the theoretical side of ML as well as current techniques that are popular such as data augmentation, K-fold validation and ensemble learning. Machine learning is particularly intriguing to me and I look forward to experimenting with new techniques in my personal projects.
