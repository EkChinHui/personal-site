**A question-and-answer platform which provokes thought and discussion about
social issues involving diversity in Singapore. Awarded 2nd place during Hack
For Good 2021.**

Up to this point, I haven't had the chance to really code something that I believed in or something that brought about positive change and Hack For Good gave me the opportunity to do both of those things. We worked tirelessly on many fronts, coding a working site, making a figma prototype as well as preparing our pitch deck to judges. I'm glad to have worked on these different areas of creating a product rather than being focused solely on programming.
